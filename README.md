## Models

Get the model from Hugging Face Transformers by searching for `TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF`. You can also use the following link:

[Hugging Face Model Link](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF)

Scroll down to the `Provided files` section and select models according to your system. We have three models:

1. `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q3_K_M.gguf`
2. `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf`
3. `models\mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf`

Create a `models` folder and store these models in it.
